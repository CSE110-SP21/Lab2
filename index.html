                    <li>Detention Meeting Times</li>
                    <p> Current meeting times are inconvenient with the schedule of 
                        the board members.  Current time frams overlaps with the time <br>
                        of Football practice, fashion club, as well as Model UN mock
                        trials. Members decided to meet at a new time of Mondays <br>
                        3:00pm - 5:00pm consistently for best attendance.

                    <li>Approval of Alligating $50 for Snack Budget </li>
                    <p> Claire Standish moved to move $50 from special projects 
                        account to snack budget account. Seconded by Brian Johnson. <br>
                        Motion carried unanimously by the consent of those present.

                    <li>Discussing Detention Changes</li>
                    <p>PRO: Detention policy creates fear and seriousness about education 
                        in students and teachers. Students will study well to crack <br>
                        the annual exams, and teachers will take the responsibility 
                        to make their students capable of getting promoted to the next class.<br>
                        Thereby the quality of education will be improved.
                    </p>
                    <p>CON: Detention policy doesn’t guarantee improvement in quality 
                        of education as long as exams can be passed by byhearting the <br>
                        content. Exams should assess the overall development of 
                        students.

                <p>Five high school students from different walks of life endure a 
                    Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal. The disparate <br>
                    group includes rebel John, princess Claire, outcast Allison, 
                    brainy Brian and Andrew, the jock. Each has a chance to tell his <br>
                    or her story, making the others see them a little differently 
                    -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will ever <br>
                    be the same.</p>
